**Matrix Calculator**

This C program provides a menu-driven interface for performing various operations on matrices. Users can choose from the following options:

1. Matrix Addition/Subtraction
2. Determinant of a Matrix
3. Matrix Multiplication
4. Inverse of a Matrix
0. Exit

### Instructions for Use:

1. **Compilation:**
   - Compile the program using a C compiler. For example, using GCC.

2. **Execution:**
   - Run the compiled executable.

3. **Menu Navigation:**
   - Upon execution, a menu will be displayed with options numbered from 1 to 4, along with the option to exit (0).
   - Choose an option by entering the corresponding number and pressing Enter.

4. **Matrix Operations:**
   - **Matrix Addition/Subtraction:**
     - Enter the dimensions and elements of two matrices, then select whether to perform addition or subtraction.
   - **Determinant of a Matrix:**
     - Enter the dimensions and elements of a square matrix to compute its determinant.
   - **Matrix Multiplication:**
     - Enter the dimensions and elements of two matrices to perform matrix multiplication.
   - **Inverse of a Matrix:**
     - Enter the dimensions and elements of a square matrix to compute its inverse.

5. **Exiting the Program:**
   - To exit the program, select option 0.

### Notes:
- Ensure that the input matrices are within the specified range (1-100) and have valid dimensions for the chosen operation.
- Follow the on-screen prompts for entering matrix elements and selecting operation types.
- The program may clear the screen based on the system. It is compatible with both Unix-like systems (using `clear`) and Windows (using `cls`).
- Press Enter to continue after each operation.
